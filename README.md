## Writing
---

2 separate writing tasks…30 minutes a pop - 15/15 split I’m aiming for in terms of planning and typing since I can type pretty dang fast.

1. Issue Task
	* 	Presented instructions on some issue, develop a well versed argument to that effect.
2. Argument Task
	* 	Given an argument and instructions to respond.  Usually involves simply critiquing their argument.

General Tips -> 
*Don’t be redundant and wordy!*
*Don’t say stupid stuff*
*Don’t say “I feel, I believe…” as  they know its my opinion*
*active voice not passive*
*dont start with stuff like “there is, it is” — STRONG openings*
*be specific to make convincing arguments with examples*
*no cliches*
*subject verb agreement aka grammar*
*don’t use weirdly ambiguous language*
*make sure pronouns clearly refer to a specific person*
*parallelism - with lists and parallel constructions they must all be the same, I’ve definitely done this before*
*consisten narrative voice*
*no slang or colloquialisms*
*avoid sentence fragments…grammar*
*I use the Oxford comma*
*semicolon can replaces comma + coordinating conjunction*
*colons are scary and I will avoid but are generally used for lists* 

*THE ISSUE ESSAY*

Take a position and explain.

The question will ask for my opinion on some topic and that’s how I know it’s this essay.

1. Take the issue/argument apart
2. Select the points you will make
3. Organize
4. Type
5. Proofread

-> Choose the side that I have the most things to say about.
-> Divide writing up into paragraphs/sections focusing on a few main ideas
-> Open with strong statement and assert position in first point.
-> Have a thesis point if I can.
-> Can use examples from life and factual knowledge


*THE ARGUMENT ESSAY*

Evaluate an argument.  The prompt for this question will ask you for examples and analysis of what makes the argument strong/weak and what could make it better.

In the prompt the writer will try to persuade me with some sort of citation.

-> “proposed explanation”
-> “evaluate the argument”
-> “how the author…his/her argument…implications…assumptions”

-> Find the conclusion and then the evidence the author provides to support that conclusion
-> identify unstated assumptions that must be true for the argument to hold
-> Identify assumptions between evidence and conclusions and then think of additional evidence that could strenthen or weaken 

-> *1st para:* show understanding of the argument by putting in own words. Then point out author’s conclusion and the evidence for it.  
-> *middle:* point out flaws in reasoning and show how argument could be invalid if this reasoning is unfounded
-> *2nd to last para:*  address a way to strengthen the argument and provide examples of evidence that would confirm the unstated assumptions. Say that without this evidence you cannot be persuaded            

Only dispute assumptions
